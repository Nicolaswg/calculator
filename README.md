Basic Calculator

In this proyect we can see a basic proyect of an calculator using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to complete this test. 

I help myself with Kevin Powell Youtube channel  https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb ... 

With his help I learn how to use HTML data-type property and others .js properties related  to Key-Types and so on.
